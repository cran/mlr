#' @title Fuse learner with the bagging technique and oversampling for imbalancy correction.
#'
#' @description
#' Fuses a classification learner for binary classification with an over-bagging method
#' for imbalancy correction when we have strongly unequal class sizes.
#' Creates a learner object, which can be
#' used like any other learner object.
#' Models can easily be accessed via \code{\link{getBaggingModels}}.
#'
#' OverBagging is implemented as follows:
#' For each iteration a random data subset is sampled. Minority class examples
#' are oversampled with replacement with a given rate.
#' Majority class examples are either simply copied into each bag, or bootstrapped with replacement
#' until we have as many majority class examples as in the original training data.
#' Features are currently not changed or sampled.
#'
#' Prediction works as follows:
#' For classification we do majority voting to create a discrete label and
#' probabilities are predicted by considering the proportions of all predicted labels.
#'
#' @template arg_learner
#' @param obw.iters [\code{integer(1)}]\cr
#'   Number of fitted models in bagging.
#'   Default is 10.
#' @param obw.rate [\code{numeric(1)}]\cr
#'   Factor to upsample the smaller class in each bag.
#'   Must be between 1 and \code{Inf},
#'   where 1 means no oversampling and 2 would mean doubling the class size.
#' @param obw.maxcl [\code{character(1)}]\cr
#'   character value that controls how to sample majority class.
#'   \dQuote{all} means every instance of the majority class gets in each bag,
#'   \dQuote{boot} means the majority class instances are bootstrapped in each iteration.
#'   Default is \dQuote{boot}.
