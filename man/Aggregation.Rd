\title{An aggregation method reduces the performance values of the test
(and possibly the training sets) to a single value.
To see all possible, implemented aggregations look at \code{\link{aggregations}}.}
\description{
The aggregation can access all relevant information of the result after resampling
and combine them into a single value. Though usually something very simple
like taking the mean of the test set performances is done.
