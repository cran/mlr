\title{Predict new data with an R learner.}
\usage{
  predictLearner(.learner, .model, .newdata, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{.learner}{[\code{\link{RLearner}}]\cr Wrapped
  learner.}

  \item{.model}{[\code{\link{WrappedModel}}]\cr Model
  produced by training.}

  \item{.newdata}{[\code{data.frame}]\cr New data to
  predict. Does not include target column.}

  \item{...}{[any]\cr Additional parameters, which need to
  be passed to the underlying predict function.}
}
\value{
  For classification: Either a factor for type
  \dQuote{response} or a matrix for type \dQuote{prob}. In
  the latter case the columns must be named with the class
  labels.  For regressions: Either a numeric for type
  \dQuote{response} or a matrix with two columns for type
  \dQuote{se}. In the latter case first column is the
  estimated response (mean value) and the second column the
  estimated standard errors.
}
\description{
  Mainly for internal use. Predict new data with a fitted
  model. You have to implement this method if you want to
  add another learner to this package.
}
\details{
  You implementation must adhere to the following: The
  model must be fitted on the subset of \code{.task} given
  by \code{.subset}. All parameters in \code{...} must be
  passed to the underlying training function.
