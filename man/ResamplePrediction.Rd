\title{Prediction from resampling.}
\description{
  Contains predictions from resampling, returned (among
  other stuff) by function \code{\link{resample}}. Can
  basically be used in the same way as
  \code{\link{Prediction}}, its super class. The main
  differences are: (a) The internal data.frame (member
  \code{data}) contains an additional column \code{id},
  specifying the iteration of the resampling strategy, and
  and additional columns \code{set}, specifying whether the
  prediction was from an observation in the \dQuote{train}
  or \dQuote{test} set. (b) The prediction \code{time} is a
  numeric vector, its length equals the number of
  iterations.
